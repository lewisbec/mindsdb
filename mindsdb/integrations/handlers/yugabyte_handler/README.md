# YugabyteDB Handler

This is the implementation of the YugabyteDB handler for MindsDB.

## YugabyteDB

YugabyteDB is a high-performance, cloud-native distributed SQL database that aims to support all PostgreSQL features. It is best to fit for cloud-native OLTP (i.e. real-time, business-critical) applications that need absolute data correctness and require at least one of the following: scalability, high tolerance to failures, or globally-distributed deployments.

## Implementation

This handler was implemented using the `psycopg2`, a Python library that allows you to use Python code to run SQL commands on YugabyteDB.

The required arguments to establish a connection are,

- `user`: username asscociated with database
- `password`: password to authenticate your access
- `host`: host to server IP Address or hostname
- `port`: port through which TCPIP connection is to be made
- `database`: Database name to be connected
- `schema`: Schema to which your table is associated

## Usage

In order to make use of this handler and connect to yugabyte in MindsDB, the following syntax can be used,

```sql
CREATE DATABASE yugabyte_datasource
WITH
engine='yugabyte',
parameters={
    "user":"admin",
    "password":"1234",
    "host":"127.0.0.1",
    "port":5433,
    "database":"yugabyte",
    "schema":"your_schema_name"
};
```

Now, you can use this established connection to query your database as follows,

```sql
SELECT * FROM yugabyte_datasource.demo;
```

NOTE : If you are using YugabyteDB Cloud with mindsdb cloud website you need to add **`0.0.0.0/0`** to `allow IP list` for accessing it publicly.
