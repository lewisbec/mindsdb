## Testing MonetDB Handler with [Voc Dataset](https://www.monetdb.org/documentation-Sep2022/user-guide/tutorials/voc-tutorial/)

**1. Testing CREATE DATABASE**

```
CREATE DATABASE monetdb_1   --- display name for database.
WITH ENGINE = 'monetdb',
PARAMETERS = {
    "user": "voc",               --- username associated with database
    "password": "voc",           --- password to authenticate your access
    "host": "localhost",              --- host to server IP Address or hostname
    "port": 50000,             --- port through which TCPIP connection is to be made
    "schema_name": "voc",        --- schema name to get tables. (Optional) Default it will select current schema.
    "database": "voc"          --- Database name to be connected
};
```

![CREATE_DATABASE](./create-database.png)

**2. Testing CREATE PREDICTOR**

```
create Predictor mindsdb.vocModel from monetDB (SELECT * from craftsmen) PREDICT onboard_at_arrival;
```

![CREATE_PREDICTOR](./create-predictor.png)

**3. Testing SELECT FROM PREDICTOR**

```
SELECT *
FROM mindsdb.predictors
WHERE name='vocmodel';
```

![SELECT_FROM](./select-predictor.png)
