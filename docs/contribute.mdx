## Contribution issues üîß

Most of the issues that are open for contributions will be tagged with
`good-first-issue` or `help-wanted`. A great place to start looking will be our
GitHub projects for:

- Community writers [dashboard](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/projects/7).
- Community code contributors
  [dashboard](https://github.com/mindsdb/mindsdb/projects/8).

Also, we are always open to suggestions so feel free to open new issues with
your ideas and we can give you guidance!

After you find the issue that you want to contribute to, leave a comment on the issue asking to be assigned to it. One of our members will assign you and update the task board. 
Then, follow the `fork-and-pull` workflow:

1. Fork the MindsDB repository
2. Clone the repository locally
3. Make changes and commit them
4. Push your local branch to your fork
5. Submit a Pull Request so that we can review your changes
6. Write a commit message
7. Make sure that the CI tests are GREEN
